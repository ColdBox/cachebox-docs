## Ortus Couchbase Extension

[Ortus Solutions](http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/couchbase-railo), the makers of CacheBox, have created a commercial extension for the open source CFML engines Railo and Lucee to support caching distribution features via Couchbase (http://www.ortussolutions.com/products/couchbase-railo).

> The Ortus Couchbase Extension is a Railo Server Extension that allows your server to natively connect to a Couchbase NoSQL Server cluster and leverage it for built-in caching, session/client storage and distribution, and much more. With our extension you will be able to scale and extend your Railo CFML applications with ease.

The extension will enhance your Railo/Lucee server with some of the following [capabilities](http://www.ortussolutions.com/#capabilities):

* Store session/client variables in a distributed Couchbase cluster
* Get rid of sticky session load balancers, come to the round-robin world!
* Session/client variable persistence even after Railo restarts
* Ability to leverage the RAM resource virtual file system as a cluster-wide file system
* Cache connection capablities for providing distributed & highly scalable query, object, template, function caching
* [Much more](http://www.ortussolutions.com/#capabilities)
