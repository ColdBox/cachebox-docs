# Downloading CacheBox

You can download the official download of CacheBox by going to the [ColdBox's downloads page](http://www.coldbox.org/download). If you have ColdBox 3.0.0 already installed, don't worry, you have CacheBox already installed. The CacheBox API docs can be found also in our [main website and are also available for download](http://www.coldbox.org/api). We highly recommend you download the latest API docs. They are definitely a high wealth of information and it will show you all the methods and properties available for operation.
