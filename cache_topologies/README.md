# Cache Topologies

There are several cache topologies that you can benefit from and it all depends on your business requirements and scalability requirements. I will only mention four distinct approaches for caching. CacheBox at this point can support all caching topologies as the underlying caches can support them. However, at this point in time, the CacheBox caching provider only supports a single instance in-process approach. However, we are working on a CacheBox server to provide out-of process caching support and a replicated/synchronized version via ColdBox Messaging.
