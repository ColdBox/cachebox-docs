# Installing CacheBox

CacheBox has been designed to work either as a standalone framework or within the ColdBox Platform. So if you are building ColdBox applications, you do not have to do anything; CacheBox is already part of the platform. The main difference between both versions is the instantiation and usage namespace, the rest is the same.
