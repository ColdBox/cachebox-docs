# ColdBox Application Enhancements

As we have seen from the documentation, CacheBox can be used in both standalone mode and within ColdBox applications. If you are building ColdBox applications, which you should :), then don't worry about creating CacheBox, it is already done for you. Just know how to configure it and how ColdBox leverages CacheBox for lots of internal key operations.

Please also refer to the [ColdBox Application Configuration](http://wiki.coldbox.org/wiki/CacheBox.cfm#ColdBox_Application_Configuration)section to learn about the conventions used to discover how CacheBox should be configured in a ColdBox application.
