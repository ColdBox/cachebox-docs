# Installing CacheBox

CacheBox has been designed to work either as a standalone framework or within the ColdBox Platform. So if you are building ColdBox applications, you do not have to do anything; CacheBox is already part of the platform. However, if you are using CacheBox as a standalone framework, just drop the distribution folder into your webroot:

```javascript
/cachebox/system
```

That's it! You can also create per-application mappings or global ColdFusion mappings to /cachebox that points to the standalone distribution folder.
