Other Requirements: You can use CacheBox as a standalone framework in which the starting component namespace will be /cachebox/system/. However, if you use CacheBox within the ColdBox core, the starting component namespace will be /coldbox/system/. Take this into consideration for all the samples, configurations and CFC paths.
