# CacheBox Report Skins

CacheBox also allows for the creation of reporting skins so you can create gorgeous looking reports for its caches, configurations, content, etc. The location of such skins is in the following location:

```javascript
/coldbox/system/cache/report/skins
or
/cachebox/system/cache/report/skins
```


The name of the folder inside of the skins folder is the unique name used to specify the skin in the custom tag. You can look at the default skin to learn from it and see how you can build skins yourself.
